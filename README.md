# Histopathology Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a baseline model for binary image classification to detect metastases in histopathology images. The model is implemented using the Fastai v1 library, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for model implementation and utility functions.
- `results/`: Directory to store model evaluation results and visualizations.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Fastai v1
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
