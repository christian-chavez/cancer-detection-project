# Histopathology Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a baseline model for binary image classification to detect metastases in histopathology images. The model is implemented using the Fastai v1 library, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. Densenet169 architectureis used.
